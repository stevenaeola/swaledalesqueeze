<p>
Cormac Begley will also be performing in <a href='http://www.otleycourthouse.org.uk/'>Otley Courthouse</a> at 7.30 on Sunday evening, 19th May, along with Anna, a professional contemporary dancer. 
</p>
<p>
Cormac is a concertina player who hails from a well-known music
family in west-Kerry. Growing up in Dublin, he was exposed to many
musicians from around Ireland, both at parties at his home in Lucan
and at sessions in Hughes pub. He is influenced by music from East
Clare, specifically from musicians such as Mary and Andrew MacNamara,
Martin Hayes and Paddy Canny. He is also strongly influenced by
musicians from Kerry such as Johnny O Leary, his uncles Tommy ‘an
Lord’ O Connor and Seamus Begley, Maurice Quinn and Muiris Ó Dalaigh.
Cormac collects concertinas and plays anglo concertinas (such as C/G,
G/D, Ab/Eb systems) and a baritone concertina (Bf/F). He has recently
recorded a duet concertina album with Jack Talty
(<a href='http://www.jackandcormac.com'>www.jackandcormac.com</a>) and is currently recording an album with his
family, the 'Begley Family'. He teaches regularly in Galway and at
festivals including Scoil Cheoil an Earraigh and Willie Clancy Summer
School.</p>
<p>
Anna was born in Wolverhampton and graduated from London Contemporary
Dance School in 2009. She then became an apprentice with Scottish
Dance Theatre and subsequently joined the company for their autumn
tour. Since 2011, Anna has danced in various projects as a freelance
artist including Grange Park Opera’s production of Rusalka and joined
Fabulous Beast Dance Theatre for their new production, Rian, which is
currently touring internationally. Anna is presently living in Dublin
and working on a new collaboration, Empty Echo, with members of DISH.

<p>Tickets for this concert are available in advance at £10 for members of the public or £8 for Swaledale Squeezers (£11/£9 on the door).</p>
