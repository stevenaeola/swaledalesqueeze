The Swaledale Squeeze is a convivial weekend of concertina playing, 
meeting friends, a concert, a ceilidh, sessions, Black Sheep bitter,
walks, the comfort of <a

Lodge</a> and fantastic scenery â€“ what  
more could a conertina player ask for?  Everything is centred on <a href='http://www.yha.org.uk/find-accommodation/yorkshire-dales-south-pennines/hostels/grinton-lodge/index.aspx'>Grinton Lodge</a> (a former shooting lodge), now a Youth Hostel, based just outside Reeth, in the picturesque setting of Swaledale in the Yorkshire Dales.";
